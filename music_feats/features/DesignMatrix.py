        oldlen : integer. 
            The length of a feature prior to downsampling
            (i.e. the length of a feature extracted by extractor).

            Either 'sc' or 'sp'. Indicates the unit of time
            to use when downsampling the feature matrix.
        cqt_hop : integer. 
            The extraction parameter value corresponding to
            cqt_hop when extract CQT feature. Default 1024 [samples].
        seconds : float. 
            The number of seconds used as the time window for the
            initial chunking of the soundfile before computing the CQT. Default 2.0.
        sr : integer.
